<h2>Hi, there!ðŸ‘‹</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! My name is Veselin and I am 24 years old and I am a backend developer. I love creating things and since early age I have had interest in technologies and especially computers and how a program or website works 'under the hood'. These two things made me apply for Software Engineering in Veliko Tarnovo University. When I started I didn't know much about programming but after some time and good amount of effort I realised that I had not made a mistake by choosing to study it and this is the thing I want to work in the future. I am interested in web development. I am most proficient in using .NET Framework (especially C#) for backend and Microsoft SQL Server as database management system.
