<h2>Hi, there!ðŸ‘‹</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Veselin, I am 22 years old and I am currently studying Software Engineering in Veliko Tarnovo University. I like learning new things related to IT industry. I am interested in web programming. My favourite programming language and the one in which I think I am the most profficient is C#, but I also like Java and JavaScript (especially React for front-end). I am currently a backend development intern at VSG Bulgaria.
